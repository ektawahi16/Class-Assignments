\section{Bipartite Graphs}
\paragraph{}
 A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets  U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V. 
\paragraph{
G=(U,V,E) is used to denote a bipartite graph whose partition has the parts U and V, with E denoting the edges of the graph. }

\section{Bipartite Matching}
\paragraph{}A matching M is a subset of edges such that each node in V appears in at most one edge in M.
\paragraph{}
\textbf{Definition 2.1} (Maximum Matching) A maximum matching is a matching with the largest
possible number of edges; it is globally optimal.
\paragraph{}
\textbf{Definition 2.2} An alternating path with respect to M is a path that alternates between
edges in M and edges in E âˆ’ M.
\paragraph{}
\textbf{Definition 2.3} An augmenting path with respect to M is an alternating path in which
the first and last vertices are exposed.}
\section{Problem}
\paragraph{}Given a Bipartite graph G=(U,V,E), Find a matching in G which has the maximum cardinality.
